					<strong> DESIGN FEATURES</strong>
				</h1>
				<h2 class="title is-3">
					The app is simple and intuitve. <br> <br> The Landing Page prompts you to write a vegetable that you would like to grow. If you type in a partial word, the app will search for all vegetables containing those words. 
					<br> <br> For example, if you type in "to" you would get results for "tomato" and "potato". The results propogate on a separate page as pictures of the search results. Upon clicking on the desired vegetable, you will be presented with a page that outlines very detailed information about how to grow the crop. This data was borrowed from the aforementioned public database.
				</h2>

					The navigation bar offers a search bar for you to search for new vegetbales. The bar also offers a home and about page which will take you to the landing page and page about the developers respectively.
